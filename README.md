# A-Peaceful-Sanctuary
Growing up in Uganda, we had a garden with all kinds of plants and flowers, however nothing stood out more than dandellions. This is a personal project that reminds me of alot of the earlier years of my life, from seeing fireworks and stars with my family to playing soccer in our garden. This was made with Javascript, HTML, CSS and another new language that 
i just picked up called SCSS. Hope you enjoy!
